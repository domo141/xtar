xtar
====

xtar is self-contained (compressed) tar file extractor with
progress indication and all file paths converted to relative
inside extraction directory (absolute symlinks, and /../ components
do not leak outside extraction directory tree).

File decompression and tar extraction support comes from selected parts
of imported source files. See the following files for the copyright
information of these parts:

- libarchive-2.8.4-COPYING (tar formats)
- bzip2-1.0.5-LICENSE (bzip2 decompression)
- zlib-1.2.3-README (gzip decompression)
- xz-5.0.1-COPYING (xz/lzma decompression)

This software is known to compile on Linux, MacOS X and Windows (XP+). If
this doesn't compile on some other Unix(-like) systems porting should not
be difficult.
