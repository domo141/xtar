This is my attempt to create portable and easily extendable tar extraction
program, which supports:

	- all tar formats supported by libarchive 2.7.0
	- gzip and bzip2 (xz in the future) decompression

Target platforms: Unix, Windows (using mingw (cross) compiler).
	- Note that archive_windows.[ch] is not included (but viewed
	  during development for hints. good stuff.)

This program includes the needed parts from libarchive, bzip2 and zlib
source code (added on demand during trial and error compilation loops).

See files

	- libarchive-2.7.0_COPYING
	- bzip2-1.0.5_LICENSE
	- zlib-1.2.3-README
